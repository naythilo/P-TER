MissingOutputException in rule install_apache_jena in file /workspaces/P-TER/Snakefile, line 62:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
/workspaces/P-TER/apache-jena-4.9.0/bin/tdb2.xloader (missing locally, parent dir contents: )
Removing output files of failed job install_apache_jena since they might be corrupted:
/workspaces/P-TER/apache-jena-4.9.0
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
