MissingOutputException in rule install_apache_jena in file /workspaces/P-TER/Snakefile, line 62:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
/workspaces/P-TER/apache-jena-4.9.0 (missing locally, parent dir contents: apache-jena-fuseki-4.9.0, .snakemake, .git, rdf4j-getting-started.iml, output, datasets, queries, input.txt, Snakefile, src, ancien-snakemake.txt, output.txt, commons.py, pom.xml, target, config, .DS_Store, README.md, apache-jena-fuseki-4.9.0.tar.gz)
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
